I would like to preface this reflection by saying due to my personal morals and beliefs I did not use ChatGPT or any form of generative AI for this assignment, I will not be doing so for any future assignments either. Currently, generative AI is harmful to the environment and actively affecting the water quality in lower income and impoverished areas. It also steals work from living artists in order to create images, often doing a worse job than a person could. I am against the use of generative AI and don’t believe it should be required to use for any assignment in a course that’s description doesn’t mention that students will be asked to use it.

Given this information, the image I created for this assignment was instead inspired by the colors of the sunset, wanting to loosely create a sunset from the perspective of a flower. Using code to create pink, orange, and yellow squares to make an ombre effect. I decided to put the flower in the bottom right corner so that it’d stand out the most and draw your eye outwards as the viewer takes in the entire image. Because my concept was a sunset from the perspective of the flower, the flower seen in my image is meant to represent shadow. This is shown by the color of the “flower” matching the darkest pink in the ombre and the petals being slightly translucent.My image is abstract, but creates a pleasant visual. Using simple shapes I think my image emulates warmth and what a flower might be feeling at the time of a sunset. The yellow represents the sun itself, and almost like a heat signature the warmth of the sun spreads outwards.
