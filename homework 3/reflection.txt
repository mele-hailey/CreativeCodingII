    Since my project is inspired by a sunset I googled “sunset p5.js” and looked at the various projects from the results. I settled on this one https://editor.p5js.org/kellylougheed/sketches/B1Deh8skz
By Kelly Lougheed to compare my updated project to. There are very clear differences between mine and Kelly’s. For example, the colors in mine are solid shapes where in hers it’s a clean gradient. She also uses blue, purple and red to make up the colors of her sunset, whereas mine can change colors based on the X and Y position of the user's mouse. Which points out the biggest difference, my project is interactive whereas Kelly’s isn’t, though the stars in hers do randomly change positions.

	I think it’s cool how people can take one word and create vastly different projects from it. A third person would take the word sunset and again, end up creating something that looks nothing like what Kelly and I coded. There are endless possibilities with coding, the medium makes it easy to create something entirely unique. As long as you know the right words to string together you can create virtually anything you set your mind to.
