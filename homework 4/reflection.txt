I used Pinterest to find the images I used in this assignment. I often use Pinterest for projects like this because it can be easier to find images (especially for collage making etc). I wanted to specifically find drawn images of my favorite foods because I felt it would fit better with how colorful my current project is. I feel like the motion, color changing, font, and particles make my project look a bit like a fever dream or hallucination of some kind. It’s really changed how my project originally felt, but certainly not in a bad way.
	I also wanted to give credit to lidecong https://github.com/lidecong on github for their p5.js examples that helped me figure out how particles work. I do have a good amount of prior experience with coding but not quite enough to create something that advanced all on my own.
